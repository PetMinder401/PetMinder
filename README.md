# PetMinder
PetMinder is a service to help you remember when to give medication to your pets via text message or e-mail. 

When you set up your PetMinder account to get started you will first want to put in your pets information (name, species, age, weight.) And then you may set up reminders for your pets by choosing the medication and setting how often the medication must be taken and for how many days. 

The app will text or e-mail you the reminders 1-3 times a day depending on how often it must be taken and will stop sending reminders once your pet has been sent it's final reminder.
